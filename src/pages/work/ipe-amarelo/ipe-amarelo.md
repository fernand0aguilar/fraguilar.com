description: "At the Art and Technology meeting of 2017 we present the work Ipê, elaborated for the exhibition on the School of Fine Arts in Porto, Ipe Amarelo interacts with the biological time in function of the exhibition's space. In the exposure proposal, the Ipê simulation is projected, and thus its life is initiated. The tree is born at the opening of the exhibition and grows, develops and only ends its life cycle with the closure of the exhibition, considering the concept of emergence."
