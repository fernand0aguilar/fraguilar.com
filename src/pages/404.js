const NotFoundPage = () => (
  <div className="row NotFound">
    <div className="col-xs-offset-2 col-xs-8">
      <h1>Sorry, but there is nothing here!</h1>

      <p>I mean this page is here, <br/>
      but its not what you where looking for.</p>

      <p>Maybe there was something else here beforeâ€¦ <br/>
      who knows?</p>

      <p>Maybe in another universe. <br/>
      or nowhere</p>

      <p>Anyway...<br/>Here is what everyone expects:</p>

      <h3>404 - Page not Found</h3>
    </div>

  </div>
)

export default NotFoundPage
